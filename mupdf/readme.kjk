A note from me (Krzysztof Kowalczyk, http://blog.kowalczyk.info)

This repository collects my improvements to fitz/mupdf code that I make while working on SumatraPDF.

fitz/mupdf is licensed under GPLv3, with commercial license available from Artifex.

All the fixes I make are placed into public domain. Note: that only applies to my changes, obviously if you're using fitz/mupdf, you're still bound by GPLv3.


Addendum:
This repository also contains patches by other authors. Unless stated otherwise, their patches are licensed under GPLv3.
