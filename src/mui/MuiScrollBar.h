// TODO: this is meant to evolve into a scroll bar (which can also serve
// as a non-scrollable rectangle bar for e.g. indicating progress) but
// it's far from it. Currently it's just horizontal progress bar that visually
// represents percentage progress of some activity.
// It can also report clicks within itself.
// The background is drawn with PropBgColor and the part that represents
// percentage with PropColor.
// It has a fixed height, provided by a caller, but the width can vary
// depending on layout.
// For a bit of an extra effect, it has 2 heights: one when mouse is over
// the control and another when mouse is not over.
// For the purpose of layout, we use the bigger of the to as the real
// height of the control
// Clients can register fo IClickEvent events for this window to implement
// interactivity

// TODO: needs to work for both vertical and horizontal cases

// TODO: needs all the other scrollbar functionality

// TODO: we don't take padding int account yet
