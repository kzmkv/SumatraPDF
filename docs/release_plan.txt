The idea for the next few releases is to make them relatively quickly,
every 2-3 months.

Major user-visible changes in each release:
2.2 - fb2 in ebook ui; new translation system as described
      in wishlist.txt; rebrand as Sumatra Reader
2.3 - text support (in it's own ui)
2.4 - hex display (can show any file in hex/text view; it's own ui)

More detailed list for 2.2:
- refactor LoadDocument() so that more code is shared between
  engine/ebook UIs and so that it loads documents in the
  background thread
- a smoother transition betwen different window types which
  doesn't involve closing the window
- mobi: closing mobi document when initial formatting is going on,
  we loose the position in the file (it gets reset to 0)
- a web-based translation system as described in wishlist.txt
  Server written in Go + python scripts to upload strings for
  translation and download translations

- closing last ebook window via 'x' if it has opened document
  leaks memory
- ???

Given aggresive schedule, it's important to make the most risky
(most likely to introduce breakage) changes first so that there
is time to stabilize the code. E.g. in 2.2, LoadDocument() 
refactoring is such a change.
